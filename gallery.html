          <p>After Alice Coaleman, Fionah became the 87th wielder of the Legendary Scythe. Despite heavy opposition from opposing parties and other rivals. Fortunately, with the help of Satsuna Sapphira and former colonel Emmalyn Koltz, Fionah was able to prove her worth against those who wanted to steal her power.

          <p>Annaleigh wields the Flame Legendetic, a power that allows her to control and create fire. Yet despite possessing this power, she tries to supress herself from using it. Because it reminds her of a childhood memory that she tries to forget.</p>

          <h2>Rebel Coaleman</h2>
          <p>Rebel Coaleman became a Captain in the Barrier Sentinels at just 24 years old. As the establisher of the Elite Militia, his legendary rise to the ranks has been met with both admiration and concern.

          <h2>Emmalyn Koltz</h2>
          <p>Emmalyn Koltz has served the Civil Guards longer than most can remember, her loyalty to Ozero unquestioned, at least on the surface. Years within the system have shown her how the regime truly operates: the corruption it hides, the truths it buries. Calm and calculating, she keeps her cards close, watching, waiting for the moment when silence can no longer protect what’s right.

          <h2>Alice Coaleman</h2>
          <p>The former wielder of the Legendary Scythe, Alice Coaleman stood as both protector and symbol of Ozero’s ideals. Her strength was matched only by her compassion, and the mark she left endures long after her passing. Between the comrades who once fought by her side and the children she left behind, her legacy continues to ignite the hearts of those who fight for truth and justice.

          <p>Satsuna Sapphira is known among the masses as the maid who cracked a conspiracy and retrieved the Legendary Kali. 10 years later, now that this legendary weapon has finally chosen its wielder through Rykko Zahl, everyone begs the question: Where is the woman who made all of this possible?
