          <h2>Nikko Bingo</h2>
          <p>Nikko, a soldier in the Barrier Sentinels’ Elite Militia, struggles with a rare genetic disease that heightens his radioactivity, leaving him sickly most of the time. To survive and fight, he relies on the Radiation Conversion Reactor (RadCoRe), a device his father built to convert his hazardous radiation into energy. This energy allows Nikko to unleash powerful blasts, channeling his body’s dangerous radiation into focused offensive attacks.</p>

As the establisher of the Elite Militia, his legendary rise to the ranks has been met with both admiration and concern.

          <p>Emmalyn Koltz has served the Civil Guards longer than most can remember, her loyalty to Ozero unquestioned, at least on the surface. Years within the system have shown her how the regime truly operates: the corruption it hides, the truths it buries. Calm and calculating, she keeps her cards close, watching, waiting for the moment when silence can no longer protect what’s right.

          <p>The former wielder of the Legendary Scythe, Alice Coaleman stood as both protector and symbol of Ozero’s ideals. Her strength was matched only by her compassion, and the mark she left endures long after her passing. Between the comrades who once fought by her side and the children she left behind, her legacy continues to ignite the hearts of those who fight for truth and justice.
