    <h2>Curator’s Note</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Ozeroan Archives</strong> is a tribute to the world within <em>Legendary Kali</em> —  
      a fictional collection of portraits capturing those who defined a nation’s rise and fall.  
      Each piece aims to preserve not just their likeness, but the fading essence of an era.
    </p>

    <h2>Artist’s Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Here's portraits of some characters of a world that i'm building. Capturing the essence of their world while giving them unique 
      personalities and roles in the story was no easy feat, but i'm glad that through these archives, I was able to sort them out a bit easier.
      I am exicted to write their stories and see their journey's intertwine in the future.
